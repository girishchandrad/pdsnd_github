## Github Project Date
The project was created on *November 18, 2019*.

## Python Bikeshare Project
A command line interactive application in Python 3 for analysing bikeshare data from **New York City, Washington and Chicago**.

## Details 
When it comes to effective analysis of data and scientific computing, python and two key packages NumPy and pandas are extensively used. The Udacity Foundation of Data Science program require analyzing data from bikeshare database. The purpose is to apply filters, understand actual phenomenon and create future predictions. 

## Installation, setup and files used.
* Check whether Python 3.x is installed by entering python in a command line for windows.
* [Article on how to install, pandas, NumPy](https://www.dev2qa.com/how-to-install-python-package-numpy-pandas-scipy-matplotlib-on-windows-mac-and-linux/)
* All three csv files viz. *chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv* and python script *bikeshare.py* must be placed in directory.
* Run python script using command line / interpreter.
